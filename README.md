## Overview ##
```text
 XSys-Malware is a kinda of Software which enable remote access, spy and manifest networks with malicious applications.

 There are two (2) main modules and utilities (1) in the repository, 
 1. prototype/server.py:
        Server  --->  run a TCP Server behind a proxy
 
2. prototype/botnet.py:
        BotNet  --->  run a TCP Agent that connects to that proxy

 3. prototype/__init__.py:
        Config           -->  a configuration utility which serve both Server and BotNet objects
        BonetSocket      -->  a wrapped socket implementation which represents a BotNet socket 
        BotnetInterface  -->  an interface module which scopes the base functionalities of a Fast Flux Interface
        Envelope         -->  the Envelope class represents a wrapped transmitted data as an object between peers
        Peer             -->  a Peer object represents the scope connection of a given endpoint / botnet in the network 
        Menu             -->  a simple CLI-GUI printable utility which display the attacker valuable information in CLI-GUI form

## Environment Setup ## 
```text
 We have only 3 dependencies:
 - pycryptodome  ~>  cryptographic module for encryption purposes
 - pyngrok       ~>  NGROK library for proxy service support
 - PyYAML        ~>  Yaml library for configuration purposes

 You can simply install all dependencies using the following commands:
  $> python3.x -m virtualenv ./venv
  $> ./venv/bin/python3.x -m pip install -r ./requirements.txt
```
---

## NGROK Setup ##
```text
 You will need to sign-in to NGROK.io and use your authtoken if you want NGROK proxy to be assigned to you faster
 Assuming you sign-in, 
 on your computer, create a new directory ~./.ngrok2  
 then, create a new file under that directory ~/.ngrok2./ngrok.yml
 
 paste this inside the file ngrok.yml
 authtoken: <YOUR-NGROK-PROXY-AUTHORIZATION-TOKEN>

 NGROK will not be able to download the binary proxy server.
 in order to make NGROK work Drag&Drop: 
 ./bin/*  ~>  ./venv/lib/python3.x/site-packages/pyngrok
```

## Server Configuration ##
```json
First, 
understand that whatever you choose to do with this tool is on your own risk and responsibility! 

Now!
At the root path of this project, lays a configuration file name [config.json] . 
This file contains a JSON structure configuration dataset which define the settings for the Server.
        
each entry in this JSON represent a set of responsible of a different section.
        
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The "incomming" section':
{
  "incomming": {
    "port": Integer,
    "backlog": Integer
  }
}
the "port" represents the port number of which the server 
accepts connections and the tunnel revers the target connection.
    
the "backlog" represents the number of connections 
for which the server can handle simultaneously.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        
The "settings" section:
{
  "settings": {
    "buffer": Integer
  }
}
the "buffer" represents the number of bytes for which the 
server and the agent will use for thier intercommunication.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The "tunnel" section:
{
  "tunnel": {
    "proto": String,
    "url": String / undefined / null,
    "port": String / undefined / null,
  }
}
the "proto" represents the type of communication protocol for which NgrokTunnel operates.

the "url" represents the actual reverse proxy domain of which our server reversed on and awaits for connections.

the "port" represents the NgrokTunnel port which directs data trafic to the mapped server session on the attacker machine.
