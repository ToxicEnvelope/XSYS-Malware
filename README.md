## Overview:
```text
 XSys-Malware is a kinda of Software which enable remote access, spy and manifest networks with malicious applications.

 There are two (2) main modules and utilities (1) in the repository, 
 1. prototype/server.py:
        Server  --->  run a TCP Server behind a proxy
 
2. prototype/botnet.py:
        BotNet  --->  run a TCP Agent that connects to that proxy

 3. prototype/__init__.py:
        Config           -->  a configuration utility which serve both Server and BotNet objects
        BonetSocket      -->  a wrapped socket implementation which represents a BotNet socket 
        BotnetInterface  -->  an interface module which scopes the base functionalities of a Fast Flux Interface
        Envelope         -->  the Envelope class represents a wrapped transmitted data as an object between peers
        Peer             -->  a Peer object represents the scope connection of a given endpoint / botnet in the network 
        Menu             -->  a simple CLI-GUI printable utility which display the attacker valuable information in CLI-GUI form

## Environment Setup ## 
```text
 We have only 3 dependencies:
 - pycryptodome  ~>  cryptographic module for encryption purposes
 - pyngrok       ~>  NGROK library for proxy service support
 - PyYAML        ~>  Yaml library for configuration purposes

 You can simply install all dependencies using the following commands:
  $> python3.x -m virtualenv ./venv
  $> ./venv/bin/python3.x -m pip install -r ./requirements.txt
```
---

## NGROK Setup ##
```text
 You will need to sign-in to NGROK.io and use your authtoken if you want NGROK proxy to be assigned to you faster
 Assuming you sign-in, 
 on your computer, create a new directory ~./.ngrok2  
 then, create a new file under that directory ~/.ngrok2./ngrok.yml
 
 paste this inside the file ngrok.yml
 authtoken: <YOUR-NGROK-PROXY-AUTHORIZATION-TOKEN>

 NGROK will not be able to download the binary proxy server.
 in order to make NGROK work Drag&Drop: 
 ./bin/*  ~>  ./venv/lib/python3.x/site-packages/pyngrok
```
